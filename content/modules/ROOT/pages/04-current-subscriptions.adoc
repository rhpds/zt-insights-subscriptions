On this tab, each entry includes the: * *Product* - The name of the
subscription * *Service Level* - What is the expectation of support from
Red Hat? * *Quantity* - How many of these subscriptions have been
purchased. * *Sockets* - The total amount of sockets provided. * *Next
Renewal* - The next date a renewal for this subscription is occuring

Next, we’ll have a look at that *usage graph* at the top.
